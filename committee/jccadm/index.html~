    Every president in American history has faced criticism, but the Nixon presidency, in particular, faced not only criticism but also deep mistrust from the public; it undoubtedly left its mark on history. From the Vietnam War, the rise of social movements that resulted from the Free Speech Movement of the 1960s, the creation of better foreign affairs in East Asia and South Asia, and the release of the Pentagon Papers to the eventual downfall of President Nixon following the Watergate Scandal, it was a presidency fraught with issues from the start. Richard Nixon was elected into office in the 1968 election, and his first term saw success in both foreign and domestic policy. However, near the end of his first term and going into his second term, Nixon resolved to fight against a left&ndash;wing conspiracy within the government and media that he believed wanted to delegitimize himself and his administration, especially due to the Pentagon Papers, which marked a turning point for his presidency. You are the cabinet of the Nixon administration tasked with deciding important government policy that will affect the outcome for these issues. This committee must actively work with the "Council of Liberty," which is the other side of this Joint Crisis Committee that consists of the press, congresspeople, top military officials, and leading opposition to Nixon. Ultimately, the fate of President Nixon, the United States government, and the American people lies entirely in your hands.

      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p>Esteemed delegates! My name is Mihir Nayar, and I will be your Chair for the Nixon Administration in the Joint Crisis Committee (JCC) at this year's UCBMUN. Richard Nixon was one of the most controversial Presidents in the history of the United States. In an era where many questioned and criticized the jurisdiction of the American government, his administration tackled many pressing domestic and foreign issues. During this committee, I hope to see lots of lively debate, creative ideas, and diplomatic partnerships between delegates. Currently, I am a sophomore at UC Berkeley studying Statistics &amp; Economics. I've had several experiences with staffing and competing at MUN conferences on the collegiate circuit. Outside of MUN, I work an on&ndash;campus job at my university in the performing arts, write articles for a journal about international business, and serve as a fundraising officer for the table tennis club. In my free time, I really enjoy studying with my friends, eating different Asian snacks, walking around campus, and listening to Bollywood music. I can't wait to welcome you all to San Francisco for a fun and memorable weekend!</p>

          Hello, honorable delegates! My name is Anthony Jorge, a sophomore intending to study Public Health, and I will be serving as the Coordinating Crisis Director for the JCC, the Survival of Nixon, this year. The 1970s were a tumultuous time in American history. Coming off of the civil rights high of the ‘60s, the ‘70s saw a number of social and political crises that would test the nation in unexplored ways, and I'm excited to see how delegates on both sides of the JCC will respond to these issues. Outside of MUN, I enjoy movie nights, sitcoms, trying to understand Cher's Twitter account (her tweets have layers), and a good book. I was born and raised in Fresno, California and can often be found explaining the intricate details of the shared Fresno experience to the uninitiated. A good smile goes a long way and I hope to share many smiles with you all throughout the course of this committee.
        </p>

        <p>Greetings! My name is Qazi Ahmad, and I will be your Crisis Director for JCC: Nixon's Cabinet in this year's UCBMUN. I am a third year majoring in Molecular and Cell Biology, with an emphasis in Cell and Developmental Biology. Outside of MUN, I am currently involved with community&ndash;oriented work through a few different organizations as well as trying to learn another language. In my free time, I love trying to cook or bake new dishes, spending too many hours playing Paradox grand strategy games, and trying new ice cream flavors. My favorite part of MUN is committees reenacting parts of history, and I am beyond excited to see how you rewrite and reshape the Nixon years in this committee.</p>

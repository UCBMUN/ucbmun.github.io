    <p>The year is 2003, and a Stanford University dropout by the name of Elizabeth Holmes has just founded the company Real-Time Cures. In hopes to &lsquo;democratize healthcare,&rsquo; the fledgling startup sought to extract tiny quantities of blood to perform a myriad of tests on. This was, of course, spurred by Holmes&rsquo; petrifying fear of needles.</p>

<p>While Holmes&rsquo; idea was notably rejected by her Professor, Phyllis Gardner, she succeeded in recruiting Channing Robertson &mdash; dean of the School of Engineering &mdash; to become the company&rsquo;s first board member. The change to the now-notorious &lsquo;Theranos&rsquo; came shortly after Robertson&rsquo;s appointment, alongside her first introduction to the world of venture capitalism in the valley.</p>

<p>Flash forward to 2004, where Holmes secured $6 million in funding. This number was quickly expanded to $92 million by the end of 2010. Alongside Theranos&rsquo; climb to unicorn status, Holmes continued to recruit an all-star lineup to join Robertson that included the likes of past Secretaries of State and Senators.</p>

<p>As you convene as the newly founded Theranos Board of Directors, the clock starts in 2013: Theranos has just launched its first partnership with Walgreens.</p>

<p>Delegates will be tasked with overseeing the company throughout its collaborations and creations &mdash; such as the Edison, Nanotainer and MiniLab. The outcome of your deliberations and decisions will leave an indelible mark on the biotech industry, and undoubtedly set precedent for the intersection of technology and medicine.</p>

<p>Most importantly, delegates will be tasked with ensuring that a sense of accountability is maintained across the company &mdash; including that of the CEO. Will you ask necessary questions about research results? Will you demand a tour of the laboratory facilities? Will you comply with governmental organizations eager to sneak a peek?</p>

<p>Plagued by scandal, marred by malfeasance, it is your responsibility to route the turbulent waters of Silicon Valley&rsquo;s unicorn era.</p>

        <p>Dear Delegates,</p>
<p>My name is Emma Solomon, and as your chair, it is my absolute pleasure to welcome you to the Theranos Board of Directors! As a Bay Area local, my hyperfixation on the demise of the doomed biotech startup is finally being transformed into the world of Model United Nations, and I couldn&rsquo;t be more excited. In Silicon Valley&rsquo;s unicorn era, Theranos provides a cautionary tale about mixing the medical field with burgeoning businesses. Throughout this committee, delegates will be challenged to examine the intersection between ethics and entrepreneurial acumen. If you are as obsessed with John Carryrou, black turtlenecks and green juice as I am, this is most certainly the place for you.</p>
<p>I have been involved in Model United Nations for a total of seven years now &mdash; beginning with my freshman year of high school and joining UCBMUN during my sophomore year at UC Berkeley. Although my senior year in college will serve as my final year within the extracurricular, there is no better conclusion than chairing this committee. This will be my first year serving as a chair at UCBMUN, having previously served as the Vice Chair in both GA Ad-Hoc and the Parliament of Singapore.</p>
<p>I am currently a senior at Cal studying Political Science with a double minor in Journalism and History. Outside of MUN, my campus involvement also includes membership in the Daily Californian Newspaper and the Sigma Kappa Sorority. I also work for the Goldman School of Public Policy, serving as a student assistant within Sec. Janet Napolitano&rsquo;s Center for Security in Politics. While my post-grad plans are nowhere near solidified, I hope to combine these interests into an eventual career in Press Law &mdash; a topic heavily relevant in the story of Theranos&rsquo; eventual downfall. When I am free, I am an avid viewer of Vanderpump Rules and anything else on Bravo. I also enjoy hiking with my mom and exploring the outdoors in hopes of checking off many National Parks on my bucket list.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to joining you all for what will be a fantastic and lively committee!</p>

      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p>Greetings Delegates, My name is Jade (she/her/hers) and I'm honored to be your Crisis Director for UCBMUN XXIX's Theranos Board of Director committee. I'm a junior from the Bay Area, double majoring in computer science and data science. I joined UCBMUN in my first semester at Cal, having previously served on Officer Board as the vice president of finance. In my free time, I enjoy biking, playing the piano and shooting hoops. Founded by Elizabeth Holmes, who dropped out of Stanford to found the company of Theranos, the company was built on dreams and ambitions of increasing and expanding access to healthcare. Although Theranos is known as a company surrounded by fraud and deceit, it is important to remember the original ideas and goals of Elizabeth Holmes, who sought to increase accessibility to healthcare. A brilliant student who was conducted research both at Stanford and internationally, Holmes took the initiative of following her dreams instead of continuing her education. However, the company of Theranos is a bitter reminder that not all dreams are possible; sometimes, it is better to embrace the truth of reality instead. As delegates explore the intricacies of balancing the promise of dreams and the difficult truth of reality, I look forwards to their growth in committee.</p>

        Best,
        <br>

      <p>Greetings Delegates, My name is Jade (she/her/hers) and I'm honored to be your Crisis Director for UCBMUN XXIX's Theranos Board of Director committee. I'm a junior from the Bay Area, double majoring in computer science and data science. I joined UCBMUN in my first semester at Cal, having previously served on Officer Board as the vice president of finance. In my free time, I enjoy biking, playing the piano and shooting hoops. Founded by Elizabeth Holmes, who dropped out of Stanford to found the company of Theranos, the company was built on dreams and ambitions of increasing and expanding access to healthcare. Although Theranos is known as a company surrounded by fraud and deceit, it is important to remember the original ideas and goals of Elizabeth Holmes, who sought to increase accessibility to healthcare. A brilliant student who was conducted research both at Stanford and internationally, Holmes took the initiative of following her dreams instead of continuing her education. However, the company of Theranos is a bitter reminder that not all dreams are possible; sometimes, it is better to embrace the truth of reality instead. As delegates explore the intricacies of balancing the promise of dreams and the difficult truth of reality, I look forwards to their growth in committee.</p>

      <p>Yours,<br>
      	Jade Mon<br>
      	Crisis Director,
      	Now We&#39;ve Got Bad Blood: Theranos Board of Directors

    Every president in American history has faced criticism, but the Nixon presidency, in particular, faced not only criticism but also deep mistrust from the public; it undoubtedly left its mark on history. From the Vietnam War, the rise of social movements that resulted from the Free Speech Movement of the 1960s, the creation of better foreign affairs in East Asia and South Asia, and the release of the Pentagon Papers to the eventual downfall of President Nixon following the Watergate Scandal, it was a presidency fraught with issues from the start. Richard Nixon was elected into office in the 1968 election, and his first term saw success in both foreign and domestic policy. However, near the end of his first term and going into his second term, Nixon resolved to fight against a left&ndash;wing conspiracy within the government and media that he believed wanted to delegitimize himself and his administration, especially due to the Pentagon Papers, which marked a turning point for his presidency. In particular, its publication fueled distrust and wariness from the American public, and Nixon's later actions would only continue to exacerbate those sentiments, losing him his political support and jeopardizing his integrity. As members of the Council of Liberty (i.e. press, government officials, and congresspeople, among others), you have the power to hold Nixon responsible for his actions by reporting the unbiased truth to the American people, and you will decide how to keep democracy alive. This committee must actively work with the "Nixon Administration," which is the other side of this Joint Crisis Committee that consists of Nixon's Cabinet. Ultimately, the fate of President Nixon, the United States government, and the American people lies entirely in your hands.

        <p>Delegates:</p>
<p>My name is Tarun Sreedhar and as your Chair, it's my pleasure to welcome you to JCC: Council of Liberty! Having a great interest in political history, I'm eager to observe how the Council struggles to balance truth, power, and democratic ideals in a time of great political mistrust &ndash; Nixon's entire second term saw public trust in government erode to its lowest point in the country's history (until the present day). About me: I'm double majoring in Computer Science and Business at Cal, with a minor in Public Policy. I've been involved in MUN in both the high school and college circuits for 6 years now. Besides MUN, I'm also involved in tech startup incubation and consulting both on and off&ndash;campus. When I'm free, I'm either binging TV (favorite shows are Game of Thrones, House of Cards, and Peaky Blinders) or rooting for the Lakers. I'm looking forward to joining you for an exciting committee!</p>

        Best,

      <div style="text-align: left;"> 
        <p>
          Hello, honorable delegates! My name is Anthony Jorge, a sophomore intending to study Public Health, and I will be serving as the Coordinating Crisis Director for the JCC, the Survival of Nixon, this year. The 1970s were a tumultuous time in American history. Coming off of the civil rights high of the â€˜60s, the â€˜70s saw a number of social and political crises that would test the nation in unexplored ways, and I'm excited to see how delegates on both sides of the JCC will respond to these issues. Outside of MUN, I enjoy movie nights, sitcoms, trying to understand Cher's Twitter account (her tweets have layers), and a good book. I was born and raised in Fresno, California and can often be found explaining the intricate details of the shared Fresno experience to the uninitiated. A good smile goes a long way and I hope to share many smiles with you all throughout the course of this committee.

      <h3>Nicole Ru</h3>
      <em>Crisis Director</em>

      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p>Hello! My name is Nicole Ru, and I will be your Crisis Director for the JCC Survival of Nixon: Council of Liberty at this year's UCBMUN conference. The release of the Pentagon Papers marked a pivotal point for the Nixon administration, precipitating a series of events that would eventually culminate in the Watergate Scandal and the downfall of President Nixon. I'm thrilled to see how this council addresses the challenge of exposing the administration's mistakes whilst navigating through a volatile political climate.</p>
<p>I am a sophomore from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania who started out in Chemical Engineering but is now hoping to major in Psychology on a pre&ndash;medical track. Outside of MUN, I was formerly involved in the Outreach Committee for the American Institute of Chemical Engineers and the Public Health Committee for the American Medical Student Association. I currently play the clarinet in the UC Berkeley Wind Ensemble, and in my free time, I enjoy playing Stardew Valley, crocheting, running, learning languages (French and Mandarin), reading, and writing novels. I'm excited to welcome all of you to this committee!</p>

        Yours,

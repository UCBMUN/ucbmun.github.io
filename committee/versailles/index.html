    In an unprecedented move to consolidate power, the year 1682 saw King Louis XIV of France build the opulent Palace of Versailles to centralize his government and royal court. With the nobility now forced to attend to him in elaborate rituals necessary to remain relevant, the internal affairs of the French monarchy have become an intricate game of royal intrigue &ndash; all under the watchful eye of the king. Meanwhile, large scale threats loom across the country. Louis XIV and his penchant for war threaten diplomatic crisis as talk grows of other European countries potentially joining forces against France. Continuously funding the royal war machine, however, could spell economic crisis and lead to trouble out of the already dissatisfied peasantry. Questions are also arising about how to deal with the growing number of Protestants that threaten the Catholic order of things.

It will be the job of the King's Court at Versailles to help Louis XIV deal with these external threats to France while figuring out how to navigate the interior dealings at the palace to maximize individual influence. It's of critical importance to bring glory to the French monarchy and &ndash; of course &ndash; long live the reign of the Sun King.

      <h3>Aruna Sudarshan</h3>
      <em>Chair</em>
      <br><br>
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p>Delegates! My name is Aruna Sudarshan, and I will be your Chair for the Court of Versailles: The Reign of Louis XIV! I am a sophomore studying data science with a minor in public policy and computer science. While I love to code, I am also passionate about politics, social justice, and philosophy. I plan to pursue higher education in data science and eventually enter a career that intersperses my many interests. I first joined UCBMUN, simply out of curiosity, after being an avid speech and debater throughout high school. I quickly fell in love with this activity. It has not only helped me hone my diplomacy and communication skills but also allowed me to find some of my closest friends and make some of my best college memories. Outside of UCBMUN, I can be found playing the flute, singing, reading, drinking too much coffee, and binging Netflix shows. Possessing a tremendous interest in European history, and having visited the Palace of Versailles in the summer of 2019, I am beyond excited to be your chair. I'm looking forward to a fast&ndash;paced, lively, and challenging committee that lives up to the greatness (and craziness) of Louis XIV!</p>

        Yours,
        <br>

      <h3>Savanna Slaughter</h3>
      <em>Crisis Director</em>
      <br><br>
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p>Bienvenue delegates! My name is Savanna Slaughter and I couldn't be more excited to be your Crisis Director for Court of Versailles: The Reign of Louis XIV. As a sophomore studying history, my friends have watched in horror as my love for history has gone from a hobby to being most of my personality. French history, in particular, attracts the full force of my fascination with history. As you might know, Louis XIV's reign was a record breaking 72 years &ndash; an undeniably impressive feat in a tumultuous time in European history &ndash; and yet, the monarchy came crashing down only seventy years later. I'm looking forward to watching the committee figure out how to prioritize dealing with a myriad of problems against the lavish backdrop of Versailles; and I sure hope to see royal intrigue and scheming worthy of the obscenely rich and gossip&ndash;loving French nobility! Other than MUN, I try to spend my free time reading the classics (and in reality, I watch The Bachelor) as well as studying French (surprise surprise). I'm also a big fan of late night Taco Bell runs, going to the beach (I'm from San Diego), and daydreaming up elaborate adventures. I can't wait to meet you all &ndash; and remember: one king, one law, one faith. Vive le roi!</p>

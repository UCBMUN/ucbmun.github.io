    The Allende Government was comprised of a coalition of left-of-center political factions in Chile all under the leadership of the Marxist President Salvador Allende from November 3, 1970 until September 11, 1973. Chile has a constitutional democracy with a legislature and judicial system. Given the actions and political goals of Allende for his presidency, economic ventures and previously private property is under the scope and ownership of the federal government at the hand of the executive branch unless otherwise checked by the Senate. The federal government also has full autonomy of the country’s military and diplomatic relations. As the coalition of the Popular Unity party government, it is within the scope of this government to make decisions regarding private and public resource allocation, and international diplomacy action including the military. This coalition of leftist parties included: The Communist Party, MAPU (Movimiento de Acción Popular Unitario), The Christian Lefts, The Party of the Radical Left (until 1972), The Radical Party, and The Social Democratic Party. The chair presiding over debate will follow UC Berkeley’s listed Rules of Procedure, and adapt to the needs of the committee accordingly. The crisis staff will respond to delegate’s notes and request under the purview of the crisis director, update delegates on the state of the crisis, and adjust responses and crisis updates as needed by the committee.

      <p>My name is Lauren Arias and I am honored to serve as your chair for the Allende Government Committee in the JCC: Allende Government v. U.S. Backed Rebels. This committee allows delegates the opportunity build or burn bridges not only within the confines of the Chilean Government, but the chance to bring rise to international mayhem or peace. Nationalist organizations, ideological warfare, foreign meddling and constitutional crises are just a few of the challenges delegates will be faced with as part of the Allende Government. I look forward to the betrayals, alliances, surprises and attacks that will develop as delegates navigate and develop the inner workings the Allende administration. As for myself, I was born and raised in Southern California and started my collegiate and MUN career at College of the Canyons. I transferred to UC Berkeley last year as a Political Science major with a minor in Public Policy, and it brings me great sorrow that I have reached my last semester as an undergraduate here at UC Berkeley. My post-graduate plans are to attend law school and pursue a career in public litigation. In the little time I have between class assignments and MUN research, you can find me complaining about something in the news cycle to my friends, on the hunt for my next favorite movie, or attending a concert in the city. This spring marks the end of both my undergraduate and MUN career, making UCBMUN XXIV the fifth and final conference I will have have staffed, and I will definitely be saving the best for last as your chair! I look forward to seeing the heated debate that will transpire as delegates navigate the political landscape faced Chilean government in the early 1970’s. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact John or myself. We look forward to seeing you in committee!</p>

      <p>Yours,<br>
      	Lauren Arias<br>
      	Head Chair,
      	JCC: Allende&#39;s Government

      <p>Welcome to UCBMUN XXIV! My name is John Perkins and I have the utmost privilege of directing your crisis for the Allende Government bloc in the JCC: Allende Government vs. U.S. Backed Rebels. I am currently a senior studying Political Science with an emphasis in International Relations at UC Berkeley and plan to attend law school upon my graduation this Spring. After matriculation from law school, I yearn to pursue my dreams and foster a legal career within either the Sports or Entertainment Law Industries. Although I am excited for the future, I am sad to say this will be my last MUN conference of my collegiate career and I intend on ending it with a bang! UCBMUN has given me so much to be thankful for and I plan to give back by putting on an amazing committee! MUN has always held a special place in my heart and has made a tremendous impact on the success of my collegiate career. This is my fourth-year partaking in MUN and my second time directing a crisis at UCBMUN. I am more than excited to see your intricate crisis notes, as well as the heated debate that will determine the future of the Allende government. Navigating through this committee should be challenging, but the fruits of your rewards will be respected through the delegate-driven updates that we plan to integrate into our arcs. When I am not doing MUN or attending class, I enjoy watching sports, snowboarding, and scuba diving! Despite my love for MUN, football remains my first love and enjoy supporting my Los Angeles Chargers!! GO BOLTS BABY!!! I hope you all are as excited as me and I am eager to see you all at UCBMUN XXIV!</p>

      <p>Yours,<br>
      	John Perkins<br>
      	Crisis Director,
      	JCC: Allende&#39;s Government

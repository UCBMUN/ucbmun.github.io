    From January 3rd to 18th, 1966, over 500 leaders of revolutionary movements in Africa, Asia, and Latin America attended the Tri&ndash;Continental Conference in Havana, Cuba. For the first time, the countries of the Global South were united to focus on issues of anti&ndash;colonialism and anti&ndash;imperialism. The conference attendees connected over their shared struggles for liberation in the context of the global wave of decolonization movements. It was radical in its approach of rejecting capitalism and the interference of the United States in communist nations, as well as in its message of international revolution with socialist motivations. Many African and Asian countries had recently gained independence or were still fighting against their colonizers, while many Latin American countries experienced changing governments and new political movements. The issues discussed in the conference are ones that continue to affect former colonial states into the present. While new political organizations and economic proposals were created, some Latin American countries had unsuccessful revolutions and some African countries struggled to gain independence. As delegates, the future of revolution is in your hands. In the words of Franz Fanon in his book Wretched of the Earth &ndash;  "The sense of time must no longer be that of the moment or the next harvest, but rather that of the rest of the world."

      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p>Dear Delegates,</p>
<p>My name is Anastasia Kaloshina and I am thrilled to be serving as your Co&ndash;Chair of the Tricontinental Conference. I am originally from Bethesda, Maryland and am currently a senior at Berkeley studying Political Science with a minor in City Planning. I have competed on the college circuit for one year and loved my time as a delegate and as a staffer including as Vice Chair of the JCC at last year's conference. I am additionally on this year's Secretariat as Director of Business Relations so this conference means a lot to me even beyond this committee. Outside of MUN I am involved in Cal Figure Skating, the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive's Student Film Committee, and the Berkeley Prisoner's Literature Project. In my free time I love to crochet, cook, and explore the beautiful nature California has to offer.</p>
<p>I am particularly excited for this committee as I hold the struggles of the Global South in decolonization close to my heart. In my IR coursework I have studied the violent struggles of former colonies in gaining independence from Western states as well as the unfair meddling of the United States in communist nations during the Cold War. Additionally, as a Ukrainian I feel a personal connection to the difficulties formerly subjugated nations face in maintaining their freedom. I am excited for this committee to illuminate a part of history that has far too often been overlooked. I look forward to the innovative solutions of delegates on these crucial issues &ndash; the repercussions of which span into the present day.</p>

        Sincereley,
        <br>

        <p>Hello Delegates,</p>
<p>Welcome to the twenty&ndash;seventh session of UCBMUN! I am Han Tseng, a rising sophomore at UC Berkeley from Hsinchu, Taiwan, and it is my utmost honor to serve as your Chair this year. I major in Political Economy&mdash; where I enjoy studying the combinations of business and economics plus international relations, law, and politics, as well as applying them to real&ndash;world challenges and situations. Ever since beginning my MUN career back in seventh grade, I have actively participated as a delegate, chair, and secretariat for seven years and attended twenty&ndash;four conferences&ndash; with seventeen of those as a student officer.</p>
<p>The 1960s when the Tri&ndash;Continental Conference took place was a crucial period in history, as many countries fought in proxy wars, achieved independence, or both as part of the greater Cold War and decolonization circumstances. Many made during the conference and actions taken afterward had significant impacts on not only the individual developing countries, but also the greater international community that we live in today.</p>
<p>In my spare time outside of MUN and academics, I enjoy traveling to remote corners of the world, tasting world cuisines, and capturing remarkable moments through photography. I hope you all will enjoy this year's conference, and I look forward to meeting everyone in March 2023!</p>

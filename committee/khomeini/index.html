    Greetings delegates, and welcome to the Committee on the Death of Imam Khomeini! This committee will feature many things, among them, dealing with the aftermath of the Iran-Iraq War, choosing a successor to Imam Khomeini, and increasing the hegemonic influence of Iran as a whole in an increasingly Western world. As you all know, Imam Khomeini was (and continues to be) the most important person in the history of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Khomeini was the most prominent leader of the Islamic Revolution, and he and his followers successfully overthrew the Shah in 1979 and brought with them the birth of a new theocratic nation. Unfortunately, Khomeini’s fire for the Revolution burned out in 1989, and the leader passed away on June 3rd after suffering through five heart attacks in ten days and overall ill health for many years. The people of Iran were so stricken with grief at the death of their dear leader that the leader’s corpse was almost lost in a funeral procession after civilians frantically reached for it to connect with their hero one last time. Over 10 million people attended the funeral. In order for the Islamic Republic to live on, Khomeini needs to designate an heir. The process of finding a successor must be done with great care and adherence to the requirements set by Islam, or velayat-e faqih. Two contenders currently exist for this spot: Hussein-Ali Montazeri and Ali Khamenei, however, the choice for succession will ultimately be based on the perceived wishes of Khomeini and the approval by the Assembly of Experts. In this committee particularly, the debate is over who rightfully deserves the position, as both candidates have previously been mired in select controversies. Additionally, the committee will have to handle relations with encircling Gulf nations who see strategic opportunity in allying with the United States, whose cultures and customs are antithetical to the religion of Islam. Strike your balances carefully, as the fate of the Republic exists in your hands.

      <p>Hello delegates! My name is Phanisri Tummala, and I am a sophomore who is majoring in Molecular and Cell Biology with an emphasis in Biochemistry. I’m originally from San Jose, so I love the Bay Area quite a bit. In my free time, I enjoy taking strolls, listening to old Taylor Swift, and mentoring in local middle schools through Project SMILE! I’m very excited to be your Chair for the Death of Khomeini Committee, which will choose Khomeini’s successor while dealing with Iran’s international relations after the Iran-Iraq War. It’s going to be a unique debate with myriad scheming possibilities, and I’m looking forward to meeting you all!</p>

      <p>Yours,<br>

      <p>Welcome to UCBMUN XXIV and the Death of Imam Khomeini Committee! My name is Leila Hooshyar, and I am extremely delighted to be your Crisis Director for this weekend. This committee will be the first one I have directed and my last one at UCBMUN, so I hope you all find it exciting, engaging, and interesting as I do! I’m a Senior double-majoring in Political Science and Society &amp; Environment with concentrations in Quantitative Analysis and Global Environmental Politics and a minor in Public Policy. At Berkeley, I’m actively involved in Model UN (obviously) and also a part of the Cal Cycling team and a tech consulting club. In my free time, I like to take day trips around the Bay Area with friends in addition to sporadically going rock climbing. In the future, I hope to go to law school, possibly picking up a joint M.P.P as well. Although this will be my first time as a Crisis Director at UCBMUN, I have long been wanting to do a committee of this kind since joining MUN in my freshman year at Cal. This topic is especially dear to my heart, as I am proudly Iranian-American and my family was personally impacted by the Iranian Revolution. I often visit Iran to see my extended family, so I am very well acquainted with the impact of the Revolution and the legacy left by Khomeini particularly on its people. While we all know who eventually succeeds Imam Khomeini in the present-day, the succession process at the time was very murky and held a lot of animosity amongst clerics regarding Khomeini’s successor. Combined with the existing geopolitical conflicts that Iran was involved in at the time, opportunities afforded by the near-close of the Cold War, and the implications for present-day politics that this committee holds, I don’t think you could have picked a better committee at UCBMUN to be in. I encourage all of you to think outside of the box this weekend, engage your holiest and more malicious sides, and make this committee memorable. As your Crisis Director, I am completely open to suggestions made politely by delegates for the course of the committee, so long as they don’t cause disruption. Please make any requests for the committee to myself or the Chair, and we will try our best to ensure that this committee at UCBMUN is your best one yet.</p>

      <p>Yours,<br>
      	Leila Hooshyar<br>
      	Crisis Director,
      	Death of Khomeini

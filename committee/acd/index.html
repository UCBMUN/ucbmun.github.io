    Welcome to the Asia Cooperation Dialogue! This committee takes place in the present day, and its purpose is to address the ways in which countries all over Asia can best promote interdependence, increase economic productivity, foster cooperation, and create a larger community. As members of this committee, the future of the world's most populated continent. It will be your responsibility to collaborate with your fellow delegates in order to produce the most comprehensive, developed, and impactful solutions. You will have to navigate and overcome deep&ndash;rooted historical political tensions, economic disparities between countries, access to natural resources, power imbalances, and the escalation of tensions due to a wide&ndash;spread pandemic. Above all, joining us in this committee will encourage fantastic and productive dialogue. Good luck delegates!

        <p>Hello Delegates!</p>
<p>My name is Danielle Kappler and I will be your co&ndash;chair! I am a junior majoring in Political Economy and Sociology. I am originally from Dallas, Texas, and have been competing on the college circuit for almost 3 years. I joined UCBMUN because I wanted to not only find an activity that gave me the opportunity to advance my research and speaking skills, but to find a community of other students who shared my passions. Joining UCBMUN led me to some of my closest friends in Berkeley, and to an organization I hold so close to me. Outside of MUN, I am involved with other international relations organizations on campus, as well as intern for a variety of federal and state legislative offices in the Bay Area. Outside school and work, you can find me wandering around Trader Joe's, going on hikes in the Berkeley hills, and taking spontaneous trips to Salt n' Straw at 11 pm in San Francisco (highly recommend it, fellow ice cream lovers!).</p>
<p>While my studies have taught me many things about political, economic, and social institutions, there is one thing continues to connect these areas and the figures in them: cooperation. In an ever&ndash;changing world, cooperation and communication is vital to ensuring stable politics, thriving economies, and robust societies. In this committee, I am excited to see you all take this powerful force to a new level. I cannot wait to see what each of you utilize to make the most of cooperation. I am thrilled to be able to witness what you all bring to committee. See you all soon!</p>

        <p>Dear delegates,</p>
<p>A warm welcome to UCBMUN XXVII and to the vibrant San Francisco Bay Area! My name is Lance Dy (he&sol;him&sol;his), and I have the pleasure of serving as your Co&ndash;Chair for the Asia Cooperation Forum. A little bit about me&mdash;I am a second&ndash;year student studying Political Economy and Business Administration and concurrently serving as Director of Finance for this conference. I started my Model UN career three years ago as a member of my high school's competitive team, which I led in my senior year and whose delegates I still train to this day. Since attending my first conference, Model UN has seen me through thick and thin&mdash;from the countless leisurely Zoom calls turned emergency meetings to the thrill of running around campus during conference with math textbooks and past&ndash;due worksheets in tow. In my spare time, you can find me perusing random articles for hours on end, indulging in philosophical banter, curating itineraries for my next getaway, overanalyzing the occasional documentary or hit TV series, or spending time with family and friends.</p>
<p>As a Chinese Filipino born and raised in the sweltering heat of Manila, I am interested in&mdash;and deeply affected by&mdash;the politics of the region. From maritime disputes to ethnic cleansing and democratic backsliding, the issues plaguing Asia are numerous and wide&ndash;ranging, yet their effects cannot be isolated to the continent alone. Much of the global order is hinged on developments in Asia, making intra&ndash;regional cooperation imperative to securing the prosperity of its people and the world at large. Through your participation in this Forum, Danielle and I hope to see innovative, well&ndash;developed solutions that advance cooperation on multiple fronts, while demonstrating a nuanced understanding of Asia's unique context&mdash;its history, material conditions, and cultural diversity that have shaped the continent for millennia and continue to do so today. I eagerly look forward to conference and wish you the best of luck!</p>

        Sincerely,

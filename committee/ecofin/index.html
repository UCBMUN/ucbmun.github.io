    Welcome to the Economic and Financial Committee: Southeast Asian Economies, or ECOFIN. This committee takes place in present day, and is meant to address the myriad of public health concerns, natural disasters, and economic crises that have developed in the post&ndash;COVID&ndash;19 era. As members of ECOFIN, you are expected to use creative thinking and collaborative planning to help stabilize dynamic and often rivalrous Southeast Asian economies. This may include building infrastructure, regulating the flow of trade between this caucus both regionally and internationally, and planning for future calamities. It is essential that this committee provides not only helpful but relevant solutions &ndash; we encourage you to plan for short term relief and long term development. Economics touches every aspect of our everyday lives, from unemployment to resource scarcity, and we hope in our time together we are able to holistically improve post&ndash;Corona topography of Southeast Asian nations.

      <em>Chair</em>
      <br><br>
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p>Dear Delegates,</p>
<p>My name is Avani Yadav, and I will be serving as your co&ndash;chair for the Economic and Financial Committee (ECOFIN) at UCBMUN XXV! I am a junior at Cal, currently studying Applied Math and Economics with a minor in English and the end goal of attending law school. This is my third year on the circuit, and my second year co&ndash;chairing the double del GA at UCBMUN! I have previously served as a speech coach for our team and now have the privilege of serving as the Head Delegate of General Assemblies and Specialized Bodies. Currently, I work as a lab manager at the Human Rights Center with Berkeley Law, where we discover and verify open source evidence for our partners to use in advocacy, reports, and legal cases. I've been lucky to do work in numerous parts of the world, and repeatedly I've found that the economic decisions made by sprawling governments heavily impact the trajectory of people's individual lives. This observation is underscored by empirical analysis presented in my classes and developed in the research work I am a part of through the economics department &ndash; my academic career centers around the fact that economics permeates every aspect of our lives.  To me, economics is the study of individual choices and how they complement, contradict and entangle with one another. In times of crisis, we hope that our past decisions have prepared us, and that our present ones will ease the burden on the future. The past year has forced Southeast Asia (and frankly, the entire world) to reevaluate our economic systems and their ability to withstand immense pressure, and I firmly believe that we are now better equipped to identify where we fall short and how to fix it. I am thrilled to chair a committee grappling with matters so deeply personal to us all, and I cannot wait to hear what you all have to say. I am sure that your innovative solutions will fill up our room in February, and I am so excited to navigate through them with you. See you all very soon, and I hope you grow to love San Francisco as much as I do!</p>

        Best, 
        <br>

      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p>Dear Delegates,</p>
<p>My name is Ananya Yanamandra, and I will be serving as your co&ndash;chair for the ECOFIN: Southeast Asian Economies for UCBMUN XXV. I am a senior at UC Berkeley, and this will be my second year on the circuit. I am a pre&ndash;medical student majoring in Public Health and Molecular and Cellular Biology of Genetics, Genomics, and Development with a minor in Data Science. As a physician in the future, I hope to pave the way for ethical medical practices and health equities in our society. In addition to MUN, I have previously competed in Congressional Debate throughout my academic career, and currently compete in both American and British Parliamentary Debate competitions. Currently, I work in the Office of Associated Students of the University of California as a Mental Health Policy Coordinator to create policies that spread the awareness of mental health issues and increase access to healthcare resources to Cal's student demographic. In addition, I work as a member of my sorority's Judicial Committee to evaluate house organization rules and coordinate fair and objective trials involving sisters in house conflicts. When I'm not studying for the MCAT, I'm dancing with my school's Bhangra team, drawing, online shopping, or creating events that celebrate South Indian culture.</p>
<p>Throughout my experiences of creating and learning about different health policies, I have learned that economics is an important policy tool that informs policy&ndash;makers, firms, and governments alike on achieving a more equitable allocation of resources. That being said, I am thrilled to be co&ndash;chairing ECOFIN to see how you all can collaborate and create both fair and pragmatic solutions to help stabilize the globalization of rapidly growing Southeast Asian economies.</p>
<p>We're so happy to be able to see you all work together, and can't wait to see what ideas you all bring to the table!</p>

        Best,
        <br>

    Welcome to the Regional Conference on Women in Latin America and the Caribbean, or WAC! This committee takes place in the present day, and its purpose is to address the rapidly evolving political, economic, and public health crises. As members of this committee, the future of over 300 million women is now in your hands. It will be your responsibility to collaborate with your fellow delegates in order to produce the most comprehensive, developed, and impactful solutions. You will have to navigate and overcome historically deep&ndash;rooted mistreatment of women, rising political tensions and reform in the region, and the escalation of gender disparities by the pandemic. Above all, joining us in this committee will make you always remember to WACspect women. Good luck delegates!

      <h3>Ayushi Balan</h3>
      <em>Chair</em>
      <br><br>
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p>Dear Delegates,</p>
<p>My name is Ayushi Balan and I am excited to be serving as your Co&ndash;Chair for the Regional Conference on Women in Latin America and the Caribbean. I am a junior at Berkeley studying Business Administration and Molecular and Cellular Biology. This is my third year on the Model UN circuit and my first time chairing! I was previously the UCBMUN XXV USG of Crisis and the Chief of Staff, External for BearMUN (UCBMUN's sister conference for high school students). Now, I have the honor of serving as our team's BearMUN Secretary&ndash;General. Currently, I am researching the determinants of lung cancer mortality rates at Harvard, the progression of esophageal adenocarcinoma at UMich, and neurons involved in reproductive related changes in feeding behavior at Berkeley. Instead of sleeping, I spend my remaining time collaborating with healthcare&ndash;related companies in Phoenix Consulting, exploring new restaurants, initiating spontaneous dance breaks with my Co&ndash;Chair, Julie, and playing with my puppy!
I believe that the topic of women's rights is incredibly relevant, especially in the face of the pandemic. While COVID&ndash;19 has created unprecedented challenges for everyone, there is no denying that women are bearing the brunt of the pandemic's economic and social fallout. I'm thrilled to tackle this comprehensive issue within the backdrop of Latin America and the Caribbean. From the forced sterilization of indigenous women casting a dark shadow on Peru's history, to Ecuador's recent decriminalization of abortion in rape cases, to the potential for Chile's new constitution to set more gender equal standards, this committee will involve a plethora of problems and diverse perspectives that I look forward to seeing thoroughly debated.</p>
<p>Welcome to UCBMUN XXVI &ndash; I cannot wait to meet all of you and hear the wonderful ideas cultivated during our committee!</p>

        Good luck!
        <br>

        <p>Dear Delegates,</p>
<p>Welcome to UCBMUN XXVI! My name is Julie Ma and I am excited to serve as your Co&ndash;Chair for the Regional Conference on Women in Latin America and the Caribbean. I am currently a Junior at Cal studying Computer Science and Molecular and Cellular Biology. Outside of MUN, I am involved in single cell RNA sequence analysis research as well as teaching various Computer Science courses at Cal. I used to be the Senior Couch of the Debate Team in my Minnesotan high school, thus I am looking forward to hearing from everyone's different viewpoints! In my free time, I like to bop to music, play League with my Co&ndash;Chair, Ayushi Balan, and experiment in the kitchen.</p>
<p>As a female pursuing a traditionally male&ndash;dominated major, Computer Science, the topic of Women's Rights has been an issue I especially find important to address. Even in this country, there are still rampant stereotypes surrounding gender and what is and is not socially acceptable for each gender. Thus, I am excited to explore how our committee will address the treatment of women in other countries, such as our neighbors down south in Latin America and the Caribbean. As the future population that will decide the majority of our world's structure, I find it important that we start to have these conversations now. Thus, I am thrilled to see what ideas will sprout from collaboration within our committee!</p>

        Best,
        <br>

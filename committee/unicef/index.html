  About the Committee
 </div>
 <br>

    The United Nations Children’s Fund–or UNICEF–is a United Nations Agency that was formed to provide aid to children in the tragic wake of World War II. Over the decades, UNICEF has expanded into a development agency focusing not only on child survival, but a holistic array of youth needs. As the world’s leader in advocating for children’s rights, UNICEF seeks to address the multitude of challenges that threaten the wellbeing of children and adolescents worldwide.<br><br>In this 2026 World Summit for Children, delegates will decide to discuss one of UNICEF’s outlined Goal Areas, focusing on either health or education in children and adolescents. This committee will also examine the role of development agencies at large, emphasizing the importance of both grassroots community involvement as well as a recognition of the broader structural factors that create poor health and educational conditions. What tools should governments draw upon to create multidisciplinary responses to these challenges? How can collaboration between different governments bring about effective change while avoiding an attitude of paternalism? How can these threats to wellbeing not only be treated, but also prevented in the face of escalating environmental and political shocks? We look forward to the answers you create together at UCBMUN XXX: UNICEF.<br><br>Topic A: Ensure that Every Child Survives and Thrives (UNICEF Goal Area 1)<br><br>In this topic, we will focus on multifaceted threats to morbidity and mortality in one of the world’s most vulnerable groups–children and adolescents. Infectious disease, malnutrition, traffic injuries, and complications during pregnancy and childbirth kill millions of children every year, and have a devastating impact on quality of life for survivors. Tragically, most of these causes are easily preventable or treatable with appropriate detection and management. Many children, however, lack either the money, geographic access, or government attention required to receive such care. While development strategies such as antimicrobial drugs, vaccines, and therapeutic food have certainly saved the lives of millions, each comes with its own set of challenges that fail to address the root causes of poor health. This committee will also examine the resilience and quality of health and sanitation systems, and how breakdowns in such facilities can cause health conditions to rapidly deteriorate. Issues such as gender-responsive health and health during humanitarian conflict will be central to comprehensively addressing child health as well.<br><br>Topic B: Ensuring Every Child Learns and Acquires Skills for the Future (UNICEF Goal Area 2)<br><br>Education is a critical way to promote skills that enable children to find employment, avoid adverse health outcomes, and become more involved with the structural and sociopolitical changes that affect their own lives. Unfortunately, over 600 million children are unable to reach minimum proficiency levels in reading and mathematics. This committee aims to help children get ready to learn in pre-primary school, teach them foundational literacy and numeracy skills in primary school, and increase long-term career education and civic engagement for adolescents. These goals come with several challenges; in many areas, education systems have to make difficult trade-offs between equitably expanding access and increasing education quality. Obstacles such as poverty, geographic isolation, gender inequality, and the digital divide are all barriers to education as well; in this topic, we will focus on these and other roadblocks to develop strategies that empower children and adolescents with the skills they need to succeed in their futures.<br><br>

        <p>Hello hello hello! My name is Adi (he/him/his), and I am beyond thrilled to be one of your Chairs for UCBMUN XXX: UNICEF! I’m a fourth-year student at UC Berkeley studying Public Health as well as Immunology, so our topics are ones that Sameera and I care deeply about. I was never a part of Model United Nations in high school, but I’m so happy that I joined UC Berkeley’s MUN team in my freshman spring semester—the friends, memories, and growth I’ve experienced through my time with the club have been incredible. This will be the 10th double-delegate GA I’ve been involved in, having both competed and staffed with the UCBMUN team for seven semesters. I have also served as a USG and the conference’s Secretary-General over its last two iterations, so I’m incredibly excited to end my time with the club with a fantastic final conference–I GUARANTEE that you’re going to have a blast at UCBMUN XXX! <br><br>
Outside of Model UN, I work in two labs focusing on cancer immunology and expanding STEM education, teach students at the primary, secondary, and undergraduate levels, and lead our school’s Fighting Cancer at Berkeley club. Otherwise, I’m probably admiring one of Berkeley’s many libraries, hiking, or exploring a new sidequest in San Francisco. Feel free to email me at adinathlane@berkeley.edu with questions–good luck and we can’t wait to meet you!</p>

        <p>Dear Delegates,<br><br>
I am ecstatic to welcome you to UCBMUN XXX's UNICEF committee! I am especially thrilled to be spending the next few days hearing your perspectives on a topic that has increasing global prevalence and is a passion of mine.
A little about myself- I am from Orange County, California, and am a fourth-year at Berkeley, pursuing Public Health on the premedical track. In addition to chairing for UCBMUN, I am a Senior Advisor for our chapter. While I joined UCBMUN to explore my interest in health policy, I stayed for the thrill of competing, the excitement of leading, and the feeling of community it has fostered. Whether this is your first or fifteenth conference, I hope you can leave UCBMUN XXX with some of these sentiments.<br><br>
Outside of MUN, I can be found thrifting trinkets, going for night drives, or eating sushi. I am sure that many of you share these interests, and I cannot wait to swap music recommendations in between committee sessions! One of my true passions in life, in addition to The Neighborhood, is advocating for children, one of our society's most vulnerable communities.<br><br>
The United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund plays a critical role in furthering the overall goal of the UN: promoting global well-being. Too often, children are robbed of their childhood to a degree where they are forced to find their own means of survival. Child poverty is a highly contested, relevant, and multifaceted topic. I encourage you to think critically about the unique landscape of remedying poverty in the context of minors, and why seemingly simple solutions may not be so feasible. With this in mind, please know that I am beyond intrigued to hear your diverse and fresh takes on a decades-old issue, and I hope you can go back home with a newfound or fortified interest in this overlooked issue. Welcome to UNICEF!</p>

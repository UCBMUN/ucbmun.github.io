        <p>Hi! My name is Paloma Corona (she/her) and I am beyond excited to be one of your chairs for this GAd-Hoc committee! I am currently a third-year student majoring in Molecular Cell Biology and Cognitive Science.</p>
<p>Originally from Mexico, I was born in Boston and have lived in multiple countries throughout my life, including the US, Croatia, Poland, Peru, South Africa, and Mexico. I joined MUN in middle school because it allowed me to engage in discussions on global issues while collaborating with others in a dynamic setting. Over the years, I have participated as both a delegate and a chair, particularly in General Assembly committees, where I’ve honed my diplomatic and strategic-thinking skills. I love the fast-paced negotiations and teamwork required in these large-scale committees, and we hope to implement something similar in this committee—challenging you with something that will push you to think outside the box. Joining UCBMUN has been a highlight of my college experience, as I’ve had the pleasure to meet the most incredible people from the club and circuit! Outside of MUN, I work at the UCSF Oakland Hospital, write for a medical journal on campus, and train our club members for upcoming conferences. In my free time, I enjoy binge watching TV shows -especially comedy shows-, running/hiking, and getting coffee with friends.</p>
<p>This committee will test your ability to adapt to extreme circumstances, think creatively, and collaborate to develop plausible solutions. Drishti and I have been working hard to craft an experience that will truly challenge and excite you—you won’t see what’s coming! I encourage you to come open-minded, passionate, and ready to debate.</p>
<p>Looking forward to meeting all of you and having an amazing committee!</p>

        Best,
        <br>

      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p>I&rsquo;m Drishti (she/her), one of your chairs this weekend for what&rsquo;s to be the BEST GAd-Hoc ever :) I&rsquo;m so excited to meet all of you and see how you deal with the twists and turns that are bound to be present in this committee.</p>
<p>A little more about me: I&rsquo;m a fourth year Data Science major at Cal and I&rsquo;ve been in UCBMUN since my freshman year. Currently, I serve as the General Assembly Head Delegate for our club, something that I thoroughly enjoy doing in my free time. This is also my fourth time staffing this conference, and third time chairing. I vice-chaired the SAd-Hoc in 2022, was chief of staff external in 2023, chaired Lok Sabha (spec) last conference, and can&rsquo;t wait to bring Laia and my GAd-Hoc brainchild to life. On the circuit I compete only in GAs, and love the collaborative aspect the activity brings to the table. I&rsquo;ve met a bunch of amazing people in my three years competing, and am so excited to end my MUN career with this committee :)</p>
<p>I was born in India but moved to the Bay Area when I was 2, and have been here ever since. If you&rsquo;re looking for recs on what to do in your free time at this conference, I&rsquo;m definitely your person to ask. In my free time I love adding onto my Lego collection, building jigsaw puzzles, trying out new recipes, and watching cricket. I also love discovering new TV shows and have recently started watching The Crown and Baby Reindeer (highly recommend but kinda morbid).</p>
<p>This committee will definitely be a committee of all time, and can&rsquo;t wait to see the unique ideas you all come up with and see the reactions to what Laia and I have in store. We encourage you to treat this like any other GA, but be creative with your solutions. There will be a lot of room to collaborate, so please make sure to have tons of fun! I&rsquo;m thrilled to be chairing this committee as my last committee, and am looking forward to meeting all of you and bonding with you. See you very soon and hope you&rsquo;re ready for it!</p>

      <p>Hi! My name is Paloma Corona (she/her) and I am beyond excited to be one of your chairs for this GAd-Hoc committee! I am currently a third-year student majoring in Molecular Cell Biology and Cognitive Science.</p>
<p>Originally from Mexico, I was born in Boston and have lived in multiple countries throughout my life, including the US, Croatia, Poland, Peru, South Africa, and Mexico. I joined MUN in middle school because it allowed me to engage in discussions on global issues while collaborating with others in a dynamic setting. Over the years, I have participated as both a delegate and a chair, particularly in General Assembly committees, where I’ve honed my diplomatic and strategic-thinking skills. I love the fast-paced negotiations and teamwork required in these large-scale committees, and we hope to implement something similar in this committee—challenging you with something that will push you to think outside the box. Joining UCBMUN has been a highlight of my college experience, as I’ve had the pleasure to meet the most incredible people from the club and circuit! Outside of MUN, I work at the UCSF Oakland Hospital, write for a medical journal on campus, and train our club members for upcoming conferences. In my free time, I enjoy binge watching TV shows -especially comedy shows-, running/hiking, and getting coffee with friends.</p>
<p>This committee will test your ability to adapt to extreme circumstances, think creatively, and collaborate to develop plausible solutions. Drishti and I have been working hard to craft an experience that will truly challenge and excite you—you won’t see what’s coming! I encourage you to come open-minded, passionate, and ready to debate.</p>
<p>Looking forward to meeting all of you and having an amazing committee!</p>

      <p>Yours,<br>
      	Paloma Corona<br>
      	Head Chair,
      	Ad&amp;ndash;Hoc General Assembly of the Director&amp;ndash;General

      <p>I&rsquo;m Drishti (she/her), one of your chairs this weekend for what&rsquo;s to be the BEST GAd-Hoc ever :) I&rsquo;m so excited to meet all of you and see how you deal with the twists and turns that are bound to be present in this committee.</p>
<p>A little more about me: I&rsquo;m a fourth year Data Science major at Cal and I&rsquo;ve been in UCBMUN since my freshman year. Currently, I serve as the General Assembly Head Delegate for our club, something that I thoroughly enjoy doing in my free time. This is also my fourth time staffing this conference, and third time chairing. I vice-chaired the SAd-Hoc in 2022, was chief of staff external in 2023, chaired Lok Sabha (spec) last conference, and can&rsquo;t wait to bring Laia and my GAd-Hoc brainchild to life. On the circuit I compete only in GAs, and love the collaborative aspect the activity brings to the table. I&rsquo;ve met a bunch of amazing people in my three years competing, and am so excited to end my MUN career with this committee :)</p>
<p>I was born in India but moved to the Bay Area when I was 2, and have been here ever since. If you&rsquo;re looking for recs on what to do in your free time at this conference, I&rsquo;m definitely your person to ask. In my free time I love adding onto my Lego collection, building jigsaw puzzles, trying out new recipes, and watching cricket. I also love discovering new TV shows and have recently started watching The Crown and Baby Reindeer (highly recommend but kinda morbid).</p>
<p>This committee will definitely be a committee of all time, and can&rsquo;t wait to see the unique ideas you all come up with and see the reactions to what Laia and I have in store. We encourage you to treat this like any other GA, but be creative with your solutions. There will be a lot of room to collaborate, so please make sure to have tons of fun! I&rsquo;m thrilled to be chairing this committee as my last committee, and am looking forward to meeting all of you and bonding with you. See you very soon and hope you&rsquo;re ready for it!</p>

      <p>Yours,<br>

    In the early 20th century, Mexico's political landscape is in chaos. Regime after regime have tried and failed to unite the nation, and the conflict for control rages into a new chapter. Soon after the installation of Victoriano Huerta as President, his despotic attitude quickly showed through to the people of Mexico. A fragile alliance of forces, including your own, have worked in concert to drive the tyrant into exile, leaving a vacuum of power in the nation. As Huerta is overthrown, the alliance loses its common enemy and the tensions between the two factions rise to the surface once again. You are among the <em>Convencionistas</em> or "Conventionists", a political faction led by Francisco "Pancho" Villa and Emiliano Zapata. As you vie for power in Mexico, you oppose the <em>Carrancistas</em>, also known as the Constitutionalists, led by Venustiano Carranza and &Aacute;lvaro Obreg&oacute;n. You must rally yourselves against the conservative and old fashioned members of Carranza's faction, to push for a new, reformed Mexican government and fill the void left by Huerta's dictatorship. To have any hope of establishing a successful government, you must not only face the military battles ahead of you, but also be prepared for the economic and sociopolitical ramifications of your decisions.

      <br><br>
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p>Hello delegates! My name is Smiti Mangla, and I will act as the Chair for the Convencionistas of the JCC at UCBMUN XXVI! The Mexican revolution was a period characterized by immense political turmoil and bloodshed; not only did the revolutionaries of this epoch fight one another for power, but they also fought each other for the very soul of Mexico. Even today, the people of Mexico venerate these leaders, and their effect on Mexican politics remains palpable. I cannot wait to see what kinds of discourse and schemes delegates employ in the struggle for Mexico's future! As for me, I am a junior majoring in Molecular and Cell Biology, with an emphasis in Genetics, Genomics, and Development. Beyond MUN and school, I take great pleasure in learning history, binge&ndash;watching Netflix, writing poetry, and going hiking on one of the many stunning trails in Washington state, where I have lived my whole life. I hope you all form some new friendships, gain more MUN experience, and take away great memories from our conference!</p>

        Best,

        <p>
          My name is Liam Quinn Wohl and I have the privilege of serving as your Coordinating Crisis Director for the Mexican Revolution. I am currently a senior studying Cognitive Science with a minor in Data Science at UC Berkeley and being from New York, I love having the opportunity to live on the West Coast. This is my eighth year partaking in MUN and my second time directing a crisis at UCBMUN. I am more than excited to see your intricate crisis notes, as well as the heated debate that will determine the geopolitical fate of Mexico. Navigating through this committee should be challenging, but the fruits of your rewards will be respected through the delegate–driven updates that we plan to integrate into our arcs. When I am not doing MUN or attending class, I enjoy film, comedy, and sports as well as competing in triathlons! I try to bring the same level of competitiveness and joy to everything I do and truly hope to see each of you rise to the challenge presented by this committee and ultimately have fun while doing so! If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me. We look forward to seeing you in committee!        </p>

      <br><br>
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p>Welcome Delegates! I am Abhinav Subramaniam, a Junior studying Mechanical Engineering at Berkeley, and it is an honor to be your Crisis Director for the Conventionists in this year's JCC: The Mexican Revolution. While I am a devoted STEM kid, I have a passion for global politics and sustainable development. I was born and brought up in Manila, Philippines and you can probably find me at 6 am scrambling to finish my homework. I'm a fan of UFC and Football, and love spicy food. I look forward to meeting all of you in our committee where I hope to see lively debate, innovative partnerships, nuanced sociopolitical frameworks and unique directive names. Our committee takes place in the early 20th century: The Mexican government was in turmoil starting with the election of the infamous oligarch Porfirio D&iacute;az. What followed was a long and bloody struggle among many different factions with fragile allegiances in a constant state of flux. The revolution not only laid the foundations for the modern Mexican political landscape but influenced Mexico's social, cultural and economic environment for generations. You as members of the Conventionist's faction must fight for solidarity in Mexico. You have the chance to change history and I look forward to seeing the result.</p>

  About the Committee
 </div>
 <br>

    Howard Stark is dead. The world mourns a talented inventor while Stark Industries mourns its capable CEO. The funeral wreaths haven't even wilted, and already the boardroom smells like tension, toner, and quiet corporate panic.<br><br>Stark Industries, a global defense giant with classified weapons tech, a questionable moral compass, and a PR team hanging on by a thread, is now leaderless. The only heir? A genius with a god complex and a bigger budget for whiskey than R&D: Anthony Edward Stark. Like his father, Tony has always had an incredible knack for brilliant invention, but hasn't had a second of PR or boardroom training in his life. Failure is likely, scandal a guarantee.<br><br>As the organization that orchestrated Howard's "accident" still schemes under the surface, and unnamed government men in suits begin "dropping by," the board has been called into emergency session.<br> Shareholders want stability. The Pentagon wants answers. Foreign governments want access. And, beginning to stir in the young heir's mind, is the idea for the greatest weapon (or hero) ever created. Inside the boardroom, alliances will be made, broken, and possibly bought. Beyond the walls lurk corporate spies, journalistic leaks, and S.H.I.E.L.D. agents in disguise. Will you pivot Stark Industries away from weapons, or transform it into a vehicle for revenge? Back the prodigal son, or engineer his downfall? Save the company, or save your own skin? Whether you defend the name or change the game is up to you. Every policy has a price. Every handshake hides a dagger. And the SEC is definitely listening in.<br><br>This isn't just business. It's survival with a quarterly report. So suit up. The fate of Stark Industries is in your hands.

        <p>Hi everyone! My name is Tanya Anand, and I'm a sophomore at UC Berkeley majoring in Global Management at the Haas School of Business and double majoring in Global Studies with a concentration in Peace and Conflict in the Middle East and North Africa. I'm from Los Angeles, but I grew up in eleven different countries! I'm beyond excited to serve as your Crisis Director for the Stark Industries Board of Directors. As someone who spends way too much time in case studies and pitch decks, I can't wait to see you merge business strategy with MUN chaos! Outside of MUN, I love tennis, Formula 1, Arijit Singh &amp; The Weeknd, and art(especially pottery)! I can't wait to watch this committee unfold!</p>

      Crisis Director

      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p>Dear Delegates,<br><br>
My name is Karis Morasch, and I am incredibly excited to be your Crisis Director for the Stark Industries Board of Directors. I am a second-year student pursuing a double major in Philosophy and Political Science. I was lucky enough to join UCBMUN last year and, in doing so, found a new passion. In the rare case that I get a moment of free time, I'm typically indulging in my love for TV shows or feeding my Letterboxd addiction. Reading, sunbathing, and thinking about those soft pretzels you can get at the mall are other favorite hobbies. It is my great honor to be working with you throughout this committee, and I can't wait to see the magic each of you will bring to our world of superheroes.<br><br>
When I was a kid, nothing brought me more joy and excitement than watching a Marvel movie, especially any featuring my favorite hero, Iron Man, but I can't help but feel sometimes that, with rising franchise fatigue, the MCU has lost some of what made it so special when it was just a team of six Avengers. This is why this committee will take us back to the dawn of superheroes: the year 1991. Howard Stark, the founder and CEO of Stark Industries, has just been murdered. In the midst of public grief and business uncertainty, a new head of Stark Industries rises to power: Tony Stark. Over the course of this committee, you will be placed in control of Tony Stark's legacy. Will you help him become the genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist of the MCU we know, or will you guide him to the downfall of Stark Industries?<br><br>
As you plan your backroom arcs, consider the superhero world as it stood in 1991. Most of the heroes and powers of the modern Marvel world are still unknown, but the foundation is being built. Under the surface, the forces that create and influence the age of heroes are forming in full force. How can you use them to your advantage? Think creatively about the resources and circumstances of this era to shape the future according to your vision.<br><br>
I'm endlessly excited to witness the work each of you will do in this committee, and I hope you are too!<br><br>
I can't wait to welcome you to UCBMUN XXX!</p>

        Best,
        <br>

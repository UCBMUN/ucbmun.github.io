              <p>Audrey (she/her/hers) is a third-year student at Cal studying Neuroscience. Audrey is from Santa Cruz, California, and participated in MUN for 3 years in high school, where she grew her love for political debate and pretending to solve world issues on the weekend. Audrey joined UCBMUN in her freshman year after looking for an outlet for her love of debate, and she has loved learning about college MUN through her time staffing UCBMUN as an ACD and a USG of Crisis in the past two UCBMUNs. In her free time, you will probably find Audrey behind her camera taking photos for her portfolio, obsessively watching college women's basketball to prepare for March, or curled up with a blanket and a good book. She is so proud of the hard work that her incredible co-lead, Cheyenne, and wonderful Secretariat have put into this conference and cannot wait to see what UCBMUN XXX has in store for us! See you all in March!</p>

She has always wanted to do MUN since high school, but never got the chance, so here she is now competing on the collegiate scale! What Cheyene enjoys most about MUN is meeting people from all over the circuit and solving the goofiest of crisis problems. Her interests outside of MUN are reading, exploring SF, thrifting, and playing video games! She is so delighted to be your Director General for UCBMUN XXX!</p>

He joined primarily as a competitive delegate but found a sincere love for balancing both conference and competition, last spring having served as USG of Crisis on UCBMUN’s secretariat. This organization has allowed Nicholas to find a community of talented and hardworking individuals, and he is endlessly grateful for the organization and every person he has had the opportunity to meet through MUN. In his free time, Nick can be found on a basketball court, rolling on a jiu-jitsu mat, or watching way too long, way too niche YouTube video essays. He is super excited to see what amazing ideas our visiting delegates bring to the table at UCBMUN XXX!</p>

She joined UCBMUN to have an excuse to dress up in WBA often, but stayed for the lovely people, circuit-wide, amazing experiences, and the energy rush within the committee. Outside of UCBMUN, you'll spot Katie on campus with an iced matcha latte in her hand. You'll spot Katie off campus with the same. You'll probably spot Katie with an iced matcha latte in hand around UCBMUN XXX as well. In her free time, Katie circles through her dozens of arts and crafts hobbies, enjoys shopping and thrifting, and also plays video games! You may or may not see her on Cookie Run Kingdom during UCBMUN XXX's lunchtime. Katie is extremely excited to staff UCBMUN XXX as Chief of Staff Generalized, and can't wait to see you at the ODS table!</p>

              <p>Penelope (she/her) is a fourth-year student at Cal studying history. Originally from Sonoma County, you can usually find her at the coast surfing or hanging around in the redwoods. She did not do MUN in high school; rather, she found love for speech and debate (Penelope is actually very shy). Upon joining UCBMUN, she found a community where the balance of seriousness and fun made her jump out of her comfort zone. UCBMUN allowed her to meet some of the coolest and most intelligent people. Other than university, Penelope enjoys making pottery, backpacking, playing chess, and cooking for people. Music-wise, she is currently into Phantogram, Beach House, ELO, Siouxsie and the Banshees, and Fleetwood Mac. She is thrilled to serve as your USG, and cannot wait to see what's in store for the delegates at UCBMUN XXX!</p>

              <p>Fiona (she/her/hers) is a third-year student at Berkeley studying Global Studies, Political Science, and Korean Language! Her love for traveling, exploring other cultures, and politics has driven her passion for foreign affairs, which led her to want to try MUN. She joined UCBMUN in her sophomore spring despite never participating in MUN before, but she quickly developed a love for debating and the incredible community at UCBMUN. Outside of MUN, you can find her getting involved in the Berkeley dance community, visiting the numerous cafes and boba shops around Cal, trying (often unsuccessfully) to keep up with new Kpop releases, and attempting to learn too many languages on Duolingo. Fiona is incredibly excited for UCBMUN XXX, and she cannot wait to be your USG of Crisis.</p>

              <p>Stefan is a second-year, chemical engineering major at UC Berkeley. Hailing from Long Island, New York, he was in high school MUN and decided to continue his delegate status in uni. While idle, Stefan enjoys collecting effigies and souvenirs, speaking Italian to himself in the mirror, and compiling incredibly long playlists where he refuses to skip songs after starting. Embracing his overattentive eye, you can find Stefan fabricating elaborate blue compositions through photography or drawing caricaturized portraits of friends and family. Whether studying history or new languages, he thoroughly enjoys learning and embracing new cultures. Obsessed with both old and new, Stefan appreciates technology and is excited to be the director of such in UCBMUN XXX.</p>

        on Secretariat in the past, Rithika is incredibly excited to welcome
        delegates to the iconic San Francisco Bay Area and is looking forward to

        year of high school, Daniel is familiar with many West coast high school
        model conferences including BMUN, SMUNC, and DMUNC. Daniel chose to
        apply to UCBMUN because he never had any opportunities staffing any
        Model UN conferences and because he was interested in competing at the
        collegiate level. Outside of UCBMUN, Daniel is part of the
        Taiwanese-American Student Association on campus and loves to read, play

        Sharicka is an aspiring Bioengineer hoping to work in Global Public
        Health and social service, but in her free time, she takes a keen
        interest in watching and critiquing documentaries and reality shows. She
        is an international student from India and is of Kashmiri descent,
        something that has contributed to her passion for global politics.
        Sharicka is passionate about international relations and their impact on
        the functioning of the internal politics of nations, which in turn
        impacts public welfare, hence, she has incorporated studying politics
        into her primarily technical academic career. On arriving at Berkeley,
        she joined UCBMUN to compete in Model United Nations conferences to
        stimulate the effect and impact of important international events. Being
        in her 6th year for competitive delegation, she believes UCBMUN has
        helped hone her skills in diplomacy and debate, along with providing her
        with necessary leadership skills. Having staffed the year before and
        competed in her own share of collegiate conferences, Sharicka is
        confident in UCBMUN's distinguishing factor as an impactful, inclusive,
        and all-rounded learning experience. She is excited to welcome talented
        delegates to join UCBMUN in the industry hub called San Francisco, and
        make this conference truly supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.

        Samuel Gao is currently a junior here at the University of California,
        Berkeley majoring in economics and statistics. Growing up from Fuzhou,
        China, he developed an interest in history, especially Chinese history,
        early on. Gradually, he also became more interested in current events,
        ultimately leading my decision to study Economics. While in high school,
        the school attempted to initiate a MUN club on campus but was forced to
        cancel due to limited interest. He was given a second chance to join MUN
        when he entered into college and have been with this community ever
        since. Outside of schoolwork and UCBMUN, Samuel is a big tennis fan and
        enjoys playing the piano. He also holds a part time job at the College
        of Chemistry as Finance Assistant. He looks forward to meeting with all
        the delegates and making this conference as best as possible.

        has now further developed her passion for international relations and

        Helen is a sophomore who has lived in 13 cities in the US, Canada, and
        China, but calls Cal and the San Francisco Bay Area home. She is an
        intended Computer Science (and business? applied math? econ? who knows)
        major. As a member of her high school MUN team, she developed a passion
        for international relations and debate, and looked forward to joining
        UCBMUN the moment she committed to Cal. Throughout her freshman year,
        the club became not only an outlet for her interests, but also a
        welcoming family and a safe space for discussion and thought. When she
        is not busy with UCBMUN, she can be found crying over bugs in her code,
        binge reading sci-fi novels, and listening to BTS. Helen is incredibly
        excited to help create an unforgettable conference experience for all
        delegates, and cannot wait to meet everyone during conference weekend.

She is an international student from India and is of Kashmiri descent, something that has contributed to her passion for global politics.

On arriving at Berkeley, she joined UCBMUN to compete in Model United Nations conferences to stimulate the effect and impact of important international events. Being in her 6th year for competitive delegation, she believes UCBMUN has helped hone her skills in diplomacy and debate, along with providing her with necessary leadership skills. Having staffed the year before and competed in her own share of collegiate conferences, Sharicka is confident in UCBMUN's distinguishing factor as an impactful, inclusive, and all-rounded learning experience. She is excited to welcome talented delegates to join UCBMUN in the industry hub called San Francisco, and make this conference truly supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.</p>

          <p>Winston is a sophomore studying Computer Science originally from Indonesia. Having discovered Model UN during his sophomore year of high school, he joined UCBMUN last spring only to have his semester cut short before he could travel to college conferences. He did however manage to staff the Reddit Board of Directors at last year's UCBMUN. In addition to being the co-Director of Tech, Ops and Design, Winston is a chair for IATA, and can't wait to meet everyone at UCBMUN!</p>

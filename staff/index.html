        Emma is a junior majoring in Political Science with minors in Public Policy and Human Rights. She is from Seattle, Washington, arguably the most beautiful city in the US. Emma joined UCBMUN because of her love for competing but found herself more drawn to the staffing and planning elements of the club. Outside of MUN, Emma does research at Berkeley Law and is a part of the Berkeley Forum, a student organization that hosts speaker events on campus. In her free time, she enjoys long walks through Berkeley, getting brunch with her friends, and drinking too much boba. Emma is both incredibly honored and humbled to be serving as Secretary General this year and is confident this will be the best UCBMUN yet.

        Daniel is a junior originally from Albany, California (around 2 miles from UC Berkeley). At Cal (GO BEARS!), Daniel is majoring in Economics and Political Science. Having done Model UN since freshman year of high school, Daniel is familiar with many West coast high school model conferences including BMUN, SMUNC, and DMUNC. Daniel chose to apply to UCBMUN because he never had any opportunities staffing any Model UN conferences and because he was interested in competing at the collegiate level. Outside of UCBMUN, Daniel is part of social impact consulting and the Taiwanese&ndash;American Student Association. Daniel loves to read, hike, play cello, and relax. Daniel can't wait to see all of you at UCBMUN XXVI!

        Priya is a second&ndash;year from Brewster, New York, double majoring in Economics and Global Studies, and minoring in Public Policy. After being involved in Model United Nations for 5 years prior to her freshman year, she knew she had to join a similar community as soon as she got to college. She joined MUN in her first semester as a freshman at UC Berkeley, and has grown her love of international relations. UCBMUN has allowed her to meet some of her best friends at Berkeley, and she hopes everyone finds a family within MUN! In her spare time, she loves to write, annoy her friends, and binge Netflix. Aside from Model UN, Priya is also involved in the ASUC and Greek Life at Cal. She is super excited to meet you all, and hopes you have a great UCBMUN!

        Vishwaa is a sophomore from New York City, planning to double major in Computer Science and Political Science with a Public Policy minor, which he hopes to combine for a career in public service. Having participated in Model UN throughout high school, he chose to join UCBMUN as a freshman to satiate his love for foreign affairs. He values the opportunity to learn about new issues, recognize how imperfect our world is, and work collectively with other delegates towards a solution&mdash;perhaps not always a perfect one. Alongside Model UN, he runs his own civics initiative, is involved in research on campus, and is a Deputy Editor for the Daily Californian's Weekender section. In his free time, you can find him bantering over how the East Coast is the superior coast, playing soccer with friends, or in line waiting to order from Yogurt Park. Vishwaa is looking forward to the conference and providing delegates with plenty of unforgettable memories!

        Justin, better known by his middle name of Kaito, is a sophomore at UC Berkeley intending to study chemical biology (and maybe something else?). From San Diego County, Kaito has had the opportunity to do MUN since his freshman year of high school; originally joining to better his communication skills, he has found MUN to be an inspiring experience where he met incredible people (although some definitely have backstabbed him in committee), and was ecstatic to join UCBMUN. Outside of MUN, he enjoys composing music and playing the viola as part of the Intermission Orchestra. He is humbled and excited to be your USG of Crisis for the twenty&ndash;sixth iteration of UCBMUN.

        Helen is a junior pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Business Administration. She has lived in 13 cities in the US, Canada, and China, but calls Cal and the San Francisco Bay Area home. As a member of her high school MUN team, she developed a passion for international relations and debate, and looked forward to joining UCBMUN the moment she committed to Cal. Throughout her time at Cal, the club became not only an outlet for her interests, but also a welcoming family and a safe space for discussion and thought. When she is not busy with UCBMUN, she can be found crying over bugs in her code, binge reading sci&ndash;fi novels, and listening to BTS and blackbear. Helen is incredibly excited to help create an unforgettable conference experience for all delegates, and cannot wait to meet everyone during conference weekend.

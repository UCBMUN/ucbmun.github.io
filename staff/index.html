He is majoring in Political Science, with a concentration in International Relations, and is double-minoring in Public Policy and City Planning.

In the past, Josh served as ACD for the Ad-Hoc Committee of the Secretary General for UCBMUN XXIII, Coordinating CD for the JCC at BearMUN I, and a diplomacy fellow for Best Delegate’s high school summer MUN institute. He is so incredibly excited to work with and see some of the circuit’s best GA delegates, and help give them what will prove to be the best GA/SB experience in the Bay Area.</p>

Outside of UCBMUN, Pranav is part of the Student Advocate’s Office on campus. In his free time, he loves to go to the gym, read, and watch reddit videos to kill time.

Planning to attend law school after completing her undergraduate years at Berkeley, she hopes to utilize her academic learning to help better legal and health resources for immigrants in the Bay Area and become more involved in unconventional channels to government and politics. Living within the metropolis of Los Angeles, Gamin loves to hike up to the Griffith Observatory every now and then, but she also enjoys cooking, traveling, and listening to podcasts. Ever since she joined the college Model UN circuit her freshman year fall semester, it has been challenging but even more exciting to befriend other politically-minded individuals and debate complex issues current legislators have struggled to find common ground on. As a Vice Chair during the previous UCBMUN conference, Gamin hopes to consolidate what she’s learned so far during her MUN journey to be a supportive, helpful, and dependable Chief of Staff Internal this UCBMUN XXIV!</p>

          UCBMUN XXIX uses a Slack double-notepad system to exchange Crisis Notes between 
          frontroom and backroom; ensure that your Crisis Delegates have downloaded Slack 
          before the conference! Only one notepad may be responded to by the backroom at a given 
          time. Please take time to draft crisis notes on your second notepad while waiting for a 
          response on your initial notepad. For more information on this system, contact us at 
          <a href="mailto:registration@mun.berkeley.edu">registration@mun.berkeley.edu</a>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The following is an overview of UCBMUN rules of procedure. For more information on 
          our policies on artificial intelligence, prewriting, and reporting forms, see our 
          Conference Policies page.
        </p>
        
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Speakers List</strong>
            <ol type="a">
              <li>
                <strong>General:</strong> After a topic has been chosen, one speakers’ list will be 
                followed for all debate on that topic area. Speakers may speak generally on the 
                topic area being considered, or any proposal on the floor. Separate speakers’ 
                lists may be opened by the dais for motions that require discussion(s) different 
                from direct debate on the topic. A member-state may add its name to a list if it 
                is not already on the list and if the list has not been closed. The Chair may 
                further limit a limited speakers’ list.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Recognition:</strong> The Chair will call upon speakers in the order in which 
                they are listed on the relevant speakers’ list. No member may address a 
                committee without having previously obtained the permission of the Chair. The 
                Chair may call a speaker to cease if the speaker’s remarks are not relevant to the 
                subject matter under discussion.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Speech Time:</strong> During debate on any procedural or substantive motion, 
                the Chair may limit the time allowed to each speaker as deemed appropriate.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Closure:</strong> If the speakers list has been exhausted, debate will 
                immediately be considered closed and whatever votes are required will be taken.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Crisis:</strong> There will be no speakers list in crisis committees; crisis 
                committees will be in perpetual moderated caucus by default.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        
          <li>
            <strong>Yields</strong>
            <p>
              No comments are in order after yields have been made. No yields are in order 
              after yields have been made. One may only yield to another delegate or to 
              Point(s) of information while the Speaker’s List is in order. A member who has 
              been accorded the right to speak on a substantive issue may yield time in one of 
              the following manners:
            </p>
            <ol type="a">
              <li>
                <strong>To the Chair of the committee:</strong> if the speaker does not desire to yield any 
                remaining speech time to another member or to point(s) of information.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>To Point(s) of Information:</strong> from other members pertaining to the 
                substance of the speech. The Chair will only count the speaker’s answer(s) 
                to the question(s) against the remaining speech time.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>To another member:</strong> if a speaker wishes to allocate any remaining 
                time to another member-state. The member that is yielded to may not 
                make any additional yields.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        
          <li>
            <strong>Point of Personal Privilege</strong>
            <p>
              A member may rise to a point of personal privilege during the discussion 
              of any matter when experiencing personal discomfort that impairs the 
              delegate’s ability to participate.
            </p>
          </li>
        
          <li>
            <strong>Point of Order</strong>
            <p>
              A point of order is used when a member finds a procedural error made by 
              the Chair or another member. A member may rise to a point of order 
              during the discussion of any matter, and the point of order will be 
              immediately ruled upon by the Chair. However, points of order should not 
              interrupt a member if they are speaking.
            </p>
          </li>
        
          <li>
            <strong>Point of Information</strong>
            <p>
              If speaking time has been limited and a speaker has yielded any remaining 
              time to points of information, then any member may raise a placard in 
              order to ask a question concerning the substance of the speech to the 
              speaker. The Chair will recognize such points of information until the 
              speaker’s time has elapsed. The speaker has the right to decline to answer 
              a point of information. Only the speaker’s answers to the points of 
              information will be counted against the remaining time.
            </p>
          </li>
        
          <li>
            <strong>Point of Parliamentary Inquiry</strong>
            <p>
              A point of parliamentary inquiry may be raised by a member who is 
              unsure of the committee’s proceedings. A member may rise to a point of 
              parliamentary inquiry only on matters of parliamentary procedure.
            </p>
          </li>
        
          <li>
            <strong>Right of Reply</strong>
            <p>
              If a delegate (not the country) is personally impugned in a speech, then 
              after the speaker’s speech time has elapsed, the member may request from 
              the Chair the Right to Reply to the speaker. The member receiving the 
              right must submit it in writing to the Chair. The Chair’s decision to accord 
              or not accord the Right of Reply may not be appealed. When the Chair 
              approves the Right of Reply, the Chair will read it out to the committee. No 
              motions for right of reply will be granted after a right of reply.
            </p>
          </li>
        
          <li>
            <strong>Comments on Speeches Summary</strong>
            <p>
              No comments on comments. No comments after yields. Comments must 
              be germane to the speech commented upon. The Chair may recognize a 
              specific number of delegates other than the speaker to comment on any 
              substantive speech. Those commenting may not yield and must keep their 
              comments germane to the speech upon which they are commenting.
            </p>
          </li>
        
          <li>
            <strong>Closure and Reopening of the Speakers’ List</strong>
            <p>
              A member may at any time move that the Chair close or reopen a speakers’ 
              list on a substantive motion. Debate on the closure or reopening of the 
              speakers’ list will be limited to two speakers in favor of and two against the 
              motion, after which time the motion will be put to an immediate vote.
            </p>
          </li>
        
          <li>
            <strong>Unmoderated Caucus</strong>
            <p>
              During the discussion of any matter, a member may motion to suspend the 
              meeting for an unmoderated caucus. The motion will be put to a vote. No 
              speeches for or against the motion will be entertained. The sponsor of the 
              motion must specify the time limit for which the meeting would be 
              suspended. The time limit is subject to the Chair’s approval and will in no 
              case exceed thirty minutes. The Chair also has the right to rule an 
              unmoderated caucus dilatory.
            </p>
          </li>
        
          <li>
            <strong>Moderated Caucus</strong>
            <p>
              The committee may request to depart from the speakers list and have the 
              Chair follow a different debate format. The motion will go to an immediate 
              vote. No speeches for or against the motion will be entertained. The 
              sponsor of the motion must specify the purpose for the moderated caucus, 
              the total time limit, and the time allowed for speeches. Only points are 
              allowed during a moderated caucus. The time limit is subject to the Chair’s 
              approval and will in no case exceed fifteen minutes; any extensions for the 
              moderated caucus may not exceed half the original time.
            </p>
          </li>
        
          <li>
            <strong>Suspension/Adjournment of the Meeting</strong>
            <p>
              A member may motion to suspend/adjourn the meeting in order to 
              discontinue all official committee functions until the next scheduled 
              session/conference. The Chair may rule this motion dilatory; this ruling is 
              not subject to an appeal. The motion is not debatable and will be put to an 
              immediate vote. Suspension is in order at the end of a session and 
              adjournment is in order at the end of the conference.
            </p>
          </li>
        
          <li>
            <strong>Tabling/Resumption of Debate</strong>
            <ol type="a">
              <li>
                <strong>Key to the Rule:</strong> Requires a 2/3 majority for tabling an agenda item.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Procedure:</strong> A member may motion to postpone or resume debate on any 
                substantive matter under discussion. Two members may speak in favor 
                of and two may speak against the motion, after which time the motion will 
                be put to an immediate vote. A two-thirds majority of the members present 
                is required to carry the motion to postpone or resume the debate on a 
                substantive matter.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Postponement:</strong> If a motion to postpone debate passes, debate on the 
                matter is said to be tabled and is placed aside without further action or 
                votes of any kind until such time as the Chair entertains a motion to 
                reintroduce the postponed item.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Resumption:</strong> If the motion to reintroduce the postponed item passes, 
                debate on the item resumes with the existing speakers list. It is the 
                moderator’s discretion to entertain a motion to close the speakers’ list and 
                open a new one.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        
          <li>
            <strong>Suspension of the Rules</strong>
            <p>
              A member may move to suspend the rules at any time when the floor is 
              open, after the general speakers list has been opened. The member must 
              specify what specific rules will be modified or discarded, to what purpose, 
              and for what period. The Chair’s decision is not subject to appeal. The 
              motion is not debatable, and an immediate vote will be taken. This motion 
              requires a two-thirds majority passage. Delegates are urged to use this 
              motion sparingly.
            </p>
          </li>
        
          <li>
            <strong>Appeal a Decision of the Chair</strong>
            <p>
              A member may appeal the ruling of the Chair only on discretionary 
              matters through a point of order. The point must be made immediately 
              after a ruling by the Chair with no motions intervening in between. The 
              Chair will speak in defense of the ruling. If the member is not satisfied 
              with the explanation, their appeal may be addressed in writing to the 
              secretariat.

                Working papers must be first submitted to the Chair in writing. The Chair 
                should read and return working papers with suggestions or point out 
                glaring mistakes. Once working papers are resubmitted, they can be 
                copied and distributed at the Chair’s discretion. Working papers not 
                approved by the Chair are out of order.

            <strong>Draft Resolution</strong>
            <p>
              After working paper becomes a draft resolution after delegates work 
              together to edit the working paper or consolidate it with other working 
              papers. The document is then reintroduced as a draft resolution. Draft 
              Resolutions can only be introduced after they have been given final 
              approval by the chair and distributed to the committee. A draft resolution 
              only becomes a resolution when the committee has passed it in voting 
              bloc.

              Though multiple resolutions may be passed on the same topic, the 
              UCBMUN Secretariat discourages insignificant, meaningless resolutions 
              and instead suggests delegates produce comprehensive, well-reasoned 
              resolutions, which further the topic under discussion.

            <strong>Amendments</strong>
            <ol type="a">
              <li>
                <strong>Format:</strong> A proposal is considered an amendment if it merely adds to, 
                deletes from, or revises the operative clauses of a resolution. An 
                amendment is considered to be out of order if it would render the 
                resolution meaningless.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Sponsorship:</strong> An amendment must have the required number of sponsors 
                and signatories to be considered by the Chair.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Editorial Amendments:</strong> An amendment may be considered an editorial 
                amendment if it does not alter the meaning, effect, or overall substance of 
                a resolution, and is introduced solely for the purpose of clarification. 
                Editorial amendments, if approved by all of the sponsors of a resolution, 
                are immediately incorporated into the resolution without a formal vote.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Friendly Amendments:</strong> An amendment may be considered “friendly” if 
                supported by all the sponsors of a resolution and does not fundamentally 
                change the intent of the resolution as a whole. “Friendly amendments” 
                pending review by the chair are immediately incorporated into the 
                resolution without a formal vote.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Unfriendly Amendments:</strong> An amendment which is not supported by all the 
                sponsors of a resolution is considered “unfriendly” and requires a majority 
                (50 percent plus one) to be incorporated into the resolution. “Unfriendly 
                Amendments” must satisfy all the stated conditions.

            <strong>Introduction of a Proposal</strong>
            <ol type="a">
              <li>
                <strong>Approval:</strong> In order for a proposal to be introduced to a committee, both 
                signatures from a proportion (set by the Chair) of the members present 
                and voting and the approval of the Chair must be obtained. Signatures do 
                not necessarily indicate support for a proposal, but rather a desire to hear 
                the proposal debated.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Sponsors:</strong> A member-state or group of member-states must express, in 
                writing, their willingness to oversee the proposal while it is on the floor. 
                The name(s) of the sponsor(s) will appear at the top of the proposal with 
                signatories appearing beneath the text. These sponsors must move to 
                introduce the proposal to the floor and will be consulted regarding any 
                motion to withdraw the proposal. The sponsor(s) may request time to 
                discuss their proposal and to take questions.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Procedure:</strong> A delegate may introduce a proposal on the current topic area 
                whenever the floor is open. Once a proposal has been introduced, the Chair 
                will entertain editorial non-substantive comments known as Points of 
                Clarification. The proposal remains on the floor and may be debated until 
                the committee closes debate on it, the committee moves to the next topic 
                area, or a procedural issue takes precedence.

            <strong>Withdrawal of a Proposal</strong>
            <p>
              Any proposal may be withdrawn from the consideration of the committee 
              if all the sponsors assent and if the Chair gives approval. Any member or 
              members of the committee can move to re-introduce a withdrawn 
              proposal by obtaining a sufficient number of signatures (the same amount 
              needed to introduce) and the Chair’s approval as with any new proposal.

        <h1>Voting</h1>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Voting Rights</strong>
            <p>
              Every member-state of each UCBMUN committee will have one vote in 
              both substantive and procedural matters, except for Non-Member 
              Observer States, which have one vote in procedural matters only.
            </p>
          </li>
        
          <li>
            <strong>Order of Voting</strong>
            <p>
              If two or more proposals relate to the same question, the 
              committee will normally vote on the proposals in the order in which they 
              were submitted. In case a delegate wants to change the order, he/she will 
              be required to raise a motion to change the order of voting of proposals, 
              along with the new suggested order. The Chair may entertain multiple 
              such reordering requests. The Chair will entertain two speakers for and 
              two speakers against the motion. A majority (50 percent plus one) of the 
              members present will be required to pass the motion. Once re-ordered, 
              proposals may not be re-ordered again; however if a section is divided out, 
              the subproposals can be reordered.
            </p>
          </li>
        
          <li>
            <strong>Division of the Question</strong>
            <p>
              Immediately after debate is closed on a proposal, once any motion 
              to order the voting has been entertained, then, before the final vote, a 
              member may motion to divide the question. This motion indicates that the 
              member wishes to consider one or more specific clauses of the proposal 
              separately. Once the motion for division has been made, the Chair may 
              entertain two speakers for and two speakers against the motion. This 
              motion will require a simple majority in a procedural vote.
            </p>
            <p>
              An initial procedural vote on whether to divide the question 
              requiring a simple majority will be taken. If it is passed, the Chair will then 
              entertain suggestions of division. The suggestions will be re-ordered from 
              most complex (most divisions) to least (fewest divisions); where 
              equal complexity occurs, the Chair will order suggestions in the order they 
              were taken. Suggestions can include a clause-by-clause division. The first 
              suggestion to pass with a simple majority will be the division that is 
              adopted. This vote is a substantive vote. When a division passes, then the 
              initial proposal is voted upon first and the division is voted upon 
              separately. This means that the proposal will be divided into a maximum 
              of two proposals.
            </p>

            <strong>Clause by Clause Division</strong>
            <ol type="a">
              <li>
                In the event a clause-by-clause division is passed, there is a three-tiered 
                vote. This vote is a procedural vote where a "yes" means to divide out and 
                a "no" means to keep the clause in the original proposal. The committee 
                will vote on each clause (not a sub-clause) individually. At the end of this 
                procedure, the committee will have two proposals: one retaining the 
                non-divided clauses and one containing the divided-out clauses. The 
                committee will then proceed to pass these two proposals separately.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Note:</strong> Use this rule carefully because proposals may become meaningless 
                due to the divided-out clauses.

            <ol type="a">
              <li>
                <strong>Requirements:</strong> A vote on a resolution may be labeled an important 
                question if it falls into one or more of the following:
                <ul>
                  <li>Recommendations with respect to the maintenance of international peace and security</li>
                  <li>The admission of a new member to the United Nations</li>
                  <li>The suspension of the rights and privileges of membership</li>
                  <li>The expulsion of a member</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Procedure:</strong> When the question comes to a vote, any member may request 
                of the Chair that the vote be labeled an important question, stipulating 
                how the vote falls under one or more of the categories. If the Chair 
                determines that the question does fall within one or more of the categories, 
                then the motion will be allowed and will be put to a vote. This decision is 
                not subject to appeal. If the motion passes and a vote is labeled an 
                important question, then the final, substantive vote on the question will 
                require the affirmative votes of two-thirds of the members present in order 
                to pass.

            <strong>Voting on Procedural Matters</strong>
            <p>
              No abstentions are allowed on procedural votes. All 
              member and non-member states present must vote on procedural matters. 
              Procedural matters include, but are not limited to, motions to adopt the 
              agenda, closing and opening the speakers list, postponement, resumption, 
              or closure of debate, caucuses, suspension or adjournment of the meeting, 
              order of voting, and the first-tier vote of the division of question.

            <strong>Conduct During Voting</strong>
            <p>
              After the Chair has announced the beginning of voting procedure, no 
              member may interrupt the voting except by raising points having to do 
              with the actual conduct of the voting. No motions other than those having 
              to do with voting are in order. The doors of the chamber must be closed 
              during voting procedure and no one may enter or leave the chamber until 
              the voting has been completed.

            <strong>Roll Call Votes</strong>
            <ol type="a">
              <li>
                <strong>Procedure:</strong> A member may request a roll call vote for a given proposal 
                before the final vote on that proposal. If the Chair approves the motion, 
                each member of the committee will vote as follows when called upon in 
                alphabetical order: Yes, Yes with Rights, No, No with Rights, Abstain, or 
                Pass.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Pass:</strong> Members who pass will be called at the end of the roster in 
                alphabetical order. A member may pass only one time on any given vote, 
                and may only vote yes or no after a pass.

            <ol type="a">
              <li>
                <strong>Key to the Rule:</strong> Do not vote with rights unless your vote diverges from 
                your policy.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Procedure:</strong> If during a roll call vote a member-state votes with rights, 
                the member-state may explain briefly why it voted in the way that it did. 
                After the vote result has been announced, the Chair will allow each 
                member-state who voted with rights to explain its vote. This right should 
                be requested of the Chair only if the vote diverges from previously 
                stated policy. The Chair may call delegates to order if these requirements 
                are not met.
              </li>

                <strong>Abstentions:</strong> are assumed to have no opinions on the matter and are not

                of votes.
